The remaining 40 percent is based on the programs each company said they created to support their people and communities in response to the pandemic. <br/><br/>Companies need to employ at least 1,000 US employees to be considered for the 100 Best Companies list, and at least 100,000 employees globally to be considered for the Best Big Companies to Work For list.                </div>\n",

Even in a year that our industry took an unprecedented hit from the pandemic and that we had to make some tough decisions about furloughing or letting go of some of our Team Members, all the actions were accompanied by tremendous hospitality, dignity and compassion. Whether it was extending their Go Hilton eligibility and reservations that would normally be cancelled or maintaining their Honors program longer than normal, or accelerating the preferred treatment that long tenure Team Members get on their unvested equity - each decision was made to do the best company could to help people in crisis. Equally significant was how leaders showed up during this year, enhancing their communications, showing support and empathy, not being shy of being vulnerable in front of others. Every company can be good in good years. Great companies like Hilton show what greatness is in crisis.</div>\n",

It was a combination of those things that helped us get through this pandemic and will continue to get through these uncertain times.

Instead of getting laid off or being forced to still go to work during the pandemic, the company has gone out of their way early on to send all of us home with equipment to be able to work from home and keep our jobs. My director is always extremely helpful when I need him, the support my team provides as well is amazing. Though I have learned a lot by working from home, I feel that I'm still fully supported even without my team members right next to my side physically. The second unique part about this company itself is how much we give back to the community. I haven't seen any other business do quite what QL has. Between donating, going out in the community to give back, donating our resources so that way we can help in any way we can during the pandemic, it is truly inspiring and has motivated me to give back much more than I normally would have.</div>\n",

There has been clear communication every step of the way during these scary times, so I've never had to worry about my personal finances. What's more, they have made it clear that taking care of our families first is the number one priority and have provided ample time to help out as needs at home have increased, including providing resources to give kids at home camp experiences and craft supplies. None of my friends have had the kind of experience I have had the last 8 months with a caring, compassionate employer.

The company also made special allowances for customers who lost their jobs and loved ones to the pandemic. The CEO and management show that they care about people with their actions. They have carefully built this company up, and used the strength of the business to help others when they can.

I particularly love that Steve [Squeri, CEO] has taken a clear stance to champion inclusion and diversity - with initiatives aimed to promote women, root out unconscious bias, and support the Black community. He's also supported LGBTQ+, voting, and immigrants' rights. He sets the tone and his leadership team and leaders across the enterprise model this behavior. He is unapologetic about it and does not hedge his support - he is all in. I've appreciated being encouraged and able to implement change in my business unit, speak up, and provide my opinion, which is so different from many other companies. The benefits offered support my and my colleagues' needs, and they went the extra mile to ensure we had support during this pandemic - covering not just testing but also treatment of COVID-19. Amex also announced early on that there wouldn't be COVID-related layoffs this year. They say in all the coronavirus memos that our well-being comes first, and that's clear in both their words and actions. Not just the job security and health coverage, but they also expanded benefits and discounts for tutoring, childcare, etc. which is awesome. ... Many of my colleagues have young children at home and it has been difficult to manage their schooling and continued development with work. They've really appreciated and taken advantage of the new offerings and the ability to work flexibly - leaders are really supportive and understanding. I have also participated in the virtual exercise classes and well-being webinars they offer each day - all free! Let alone the stuff we all know - 20 weeks of parental leave and a good PTO pot (that we are actually encouraged to take!).</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">NVIDIA has always been a unique place. But with the Covid pandemic this has come to light in ways I couldn't even imagine. The pandemic has been a very sad episode of our human history - and Jensen [Huang, CEO] and the leadership team have been one of the few sources of light and inspiration. At least for me. The company-wide emails and actions that were taken are clear examples of what true leaders do. In a few of those emails I would literally have tears in my eyes by the time I finished reading it. Compassion and a clear set of priorities, focused on people not just profit, are what usually make a huge difference. And it is especially true when there is a global pandemic going around. I can't be more proud to be part of NVIDIA. It is not just a job. It is family.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">At the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic, David Weekley Homes responded quickly by coming up with a plan for us, the team members. In the first email we were given three additional PTO days to use between March and December. We were offered 2 weeks pay if we needed to quarantine or got the virus and working from home became an option and highly suggested. A few weeks later another communication was released stating if you were afraid of coming to work or working at all, the company would pay (after we used our PTO) 50% of our pay for a month; if we still didn't feel like returning to work or working from home we were and still are able to be off for really an unlimited time. The company would pay for Health Benefits while the team members was on this leave. If you had to take care of your kids because of home/online schooling you were also able to take this leave. One other way David Weekley Homes showed they care about the team members is if you are a parent and cannot find day care for your children or do not think its safe, if your position allows it, you can work from home until end of August. If you feel, you cannot work 40 hours and you can only work 30 or less, you will not lose your health benefits. Since March the company and Mr. David Weekley have been communicating with us on a very regular basis, be that by email or a video with Mr. Weekley speaking to us. I really don't see how any other company like ours stepped up for its team members and customers to feel safe working here or visiting a model home.</div>\n",

We got hit hard in hospitality, and for as many positions that could be furloughed to be, with a few months of 20% pay and supplemental healthcare pricing extended through as long as it could be offered, meant so much during a very hard time. Marriott even partnered with outside companies that were hiring, both in hourly positions as well as executive positions, and worked with us to ensure we as associates had access and a reference to get a new job / career, if we chose that path. This just really proved the company was going to do all they could to keep the company afloat, but ensure their associates were well taken care of. Communication through the pandemic was also prompt, clear and nothing of importance that would affect our life was kept from us. On furlough, senior leadership called (voluntary) monthly update calls where we could log in and learn what was happening with the company. Our small teams had weekly voluntary team calls to catch up on life. Prior to the Covid era, I was 90% in on my company … during (and now after), I am 1000% all in as I got to see a more personal side of a very large company, and we are overcoming this pandemic as a family. For as large of a company we are, I never once felt I was alone over the last 8 months. Again, hands down the absolute best handling of the situation, keeping associates top of mind and of course, keeping the highest standards of cleanliness in travel.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">Kimpton truly goes to bat for its employees and while this has always been apparent in my four years with the company, the last 7 months during the pandemic have truly given them the opportunity to make this known on a mass scale. While we were forced to close almost 100% of our properties back in March (in fact, I work out of a property that is is STILL closed with no solid reopening date in sight) Kimpton quickly went into overdrive to ensure that the teams across the country were taken care of. This massive effort took the following forms, just to name a few: Kimpton immediately partnered with a few large corporations that would need to ramp up on hiring during the crisis, like Amazon and several national grocery brands, on a hiring program that would allow out-of-work Kimptonites to gain employment with these companies WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO INTERVIEW but simply be hired based on the fact that they were Kimpton employees; leadership coordinated with almost every state's unemployment agencies in order to help laid off team members apply for unemployment immediately as well as find funds, loans, charities that would be able to assist our team members during this time of need; and most dear to my heart, Kimpton asserted from early on to the owners of each and every property/restaurant that there were certain non-negotiable positions at every property that were to be maintained despite closures. I've worked in the industry for over 15 years and have friends/former colleagues scattered across the country and not one of their hotel management companies stood up to ownership on their behalf to make these types of assertions. When you ask if Kimpton has my back, if I'm proud to work here, and if they are truly a great place to work my answer is clear and concise- YES!!!</div>\n",

I feel like Adobe has been very transparent with its employees and has done an awesome job making informed decisions and pivoting when needed. It started with the quick shift to WFH for the safety and health of employees before many other companies decided to do so and before the shelter in place order in the Bay Area was implemented. Adobe has halted hiring to avoid layoffs during covid-19 and that gives employees a sense of security during this time when so many are struggling financially. Also, receiving emergency alerts from GSOC assures me that Adobe cares about my personal safety. All the trainings on emotional wellbeing and coping during this time shows that Adobe cares about our mental health. Lastly, the timely messages we receive from Shantanu [Narayen, CEO] regarding current events and how we are to react and behave as Adobe employees is an awesome example of his incredible leadership. In a time of uncertainty, stress, and fear, I feel fortunate to be an Adobe employee.</div>\n",

They moved quickly to offer work from home solutions not only for the main campuses, but for the branches as well. They have helped those in financial need, those with physical health needs, those with mental health needs and those with family support challenges. They were creative in finding ways to keep us safe, informed, connected, supported and appreciated. This company is FAMILY!</div>\n",

I went into the year with huge gratitude to the Bank and my manager for their assistance through tough times. The crisis, and seeing how proactive the bank was in managing the practical and caring side of the response, the conversations following George Floyd's death, and the commitments we've made to our communities all speak volumes about not only doing our jobs well, but doing the right thing.

The firm transitioned to remote working in just 10 days and provided all employees, regardless of their role in the company, any and all resources needed to work from home and cope with the emotional stress of these difficult months. For example, the firm sent monitors, laptops, mouses, keyboards, and video cameras directly to households, provided Emergency Care Time we can use to our discretion to tend to health/childcare needs, allowed employees to take home anything from the office (such as a desk chair), and rolled-out many additional benefits, such as a free subscription to Headspace (the meditation app) to further promote wellness during this stressful time. Our management was transparent in the firm's response, next steps, and the general state of the firm. We have many opportunities to virtually connect with co-workers through happy hours and more frequent staff meetings. I feel like all my concerns have been addressed and the firm truly cares for employees' day-to-day happiness, safety, and mental health.</div>\n",

Our CEO has personally extended this pay rate through September where so many other essential businesses have suspended it. Although it is still concerning having so much exposure due to our service to the public, I feel comforted to know that if I get sick I will be taken care of because of the financial stability and amazing benefits the company has always offered. Our company made the decision to require face masks for every guest and associate a FULL month prior to it being a state mandate. We have been diligent to regulate this in order to ensure a safe environment for so many and still excel at world class levels of service! These actions of safety prove that our executive team are protecting ALL of our associates and are constantly looking for ways to make it safer for everyone to be in. If there was any good reason to have Nugget Markets be one of the top 10 on your list, it should be for the protocols in place for being a force in safety for the public. I am proud to be apart of this company that may be small in size, but delivers nothing short of gigantic positive impacts!</div>\n",

Leadership made the safety and well-being of associates its top priority. Associates have been able to work from home. Even though earnings have been under pressure, no associate has seen a cut in pay, and there have been no layoffs and no furloughs. We have continued to focus on building strong teams and ensuring that associates feel valued and secure. Client safety and soundness became a top priority. When it would be easy to make decisions that affect near-term results, our leadership has focused on sustaining long-term relationships with our clients by ensuring that we treat them fairly and provide sound financial advice in these difficult times.

Great care has been given to support not only the health of employees, but our emotional wellbeing as well. Through town halls, company wide emails, and newsletters, we are kept in the loop on how decisions are being made in response to the pandemic. Red Hat started Recharge days - an extra holiday every quarter during the pandemic - to encourage us to log off. This to me is going above and beyond to help out their employees. Additionally, the response from Red Hat to the racial tension has been better than I have ever experienced at a company. Extra care and support was given to my colleagues who are BIPOC. Anti-racism education and diversity &amp; inclusion programs have grown, further demonstrating that Red Hat truly embodies an inclusive organization that values diversity. At a time when we are physically separated, I feel that Red Hat is finding ways to encourage and foster connection. While work looks a lot different today than it did a few months ago, I feel supported and able to do my job remotely without feeling disconnected. Through different online collaboration tools provided by Red Hat, I am in constant contact with my team and didn't lose a beat when my work became home-based. I feel incredibly fortunate to work at Red Hat, and talking with friends and family, I feel that Red Hat is head and shoulders above other companies in benefits, culture, wellbeing, opportunity, and productivity.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">The Executive Leadership team has done a superb job of handling the dynamic environment created from the Coronavirus pandemic. They had the foresight to send employees home early, even before state governments recognized the need for social distancing. They have been communicating frequently and transparently about how the business is doing, how they're working to keep employees safe and the additional benefits they've added for childcare, mental and emotional health, etc. Synchrony Summer Camp was an initiative that was put together very quickly to provide working parents with support for their children over the summer knowing that parents would be working virtually and many households would be sheltering in place due to the pandemic. It was a brilliant idea and executed beautifully, utilizing older children as camp counselors for the younger children. My children loved the program and were excited to do science experiements, yoga, learn new skills, etc. It was such a nice benefit and demonstrated how thoughtful Senior Leadership was about the struggles of their employees who are working parents. Synchrony's culture is beautifully unique, it's hard to describe it, it's something you just feel, it feels like family. You are surrounded by people who truly care about you as a person and we're working together toward a common purpose that we all believe in. You see this from the top down.</div>\n",

In 2020, the Company surpassed all my expectations in responding to the COVID pandemic. Leadership was clear in both messaging AND ACTIONS that top priorities were employee safety, avoiding layoffs, and promoting well-being. There were frequent webcasts to keep all of us updated, provide ongoing guidance on working virtually, and team together. This frequent connection allowed us to not only address Firm matters, but to band together on other developments in our nation needing our involvement and passion - such as racial injustice. I have always been proud to work at PwC - but never more so than in 2020.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">The firm has done an amazing job at adapting to recent health and social issues that are at the forefront of society. With the pandemic, leadership communicated early and often, acted in a timely manner to prevent staff from exposure, implemented a program for individuals to take equipment to their home offices, and asked employees about their thoughts on returning to the office. While working from home, communication has increased via meetings and all hands calls to promote a sense of connection and understanding about firm updates. I am confident that when the offices do reopen, leadership will ensure that it is as safe as possible and will continue to allow individuals and teams to work from home if they desire. With the recent social justice movement, leadership, all the way to the Chairman and CEO, expressed that recent events did not align to our firm's core values. My local leadership set up a call with all of the black employees within our practice, including myself, and allowed us to tell our stories and ask questions about how we make our firm and the community a more accepting, understanding, and just place. It was a powerful session with both black partners and employees expressing sometimes painful or hard stories to tell. After the session, leadership that identified as allies of the movement reached out to their staff to allow them to express themselves, share their feelings, and discuss how we can better support one another. It was my proudest moment to be a member at the firm and KPMG continues to commit to social justice and equality movements.</div>\n",

Atlassian has offered programs and resources focused on mental health and burnout. They've offered allowances to make sure WFH set up is solid if a person is normally in an office. We've reimagined where teams need to be to work well together. We've encouraged people to take time away beyond what people may have as a normal amount of vacation time, to recharge from COVID impacts. We've acknowledged that not all people have the same impacts from COVID and have adjusted bonus eligibility accordingly. Our Workplace Experience Team has created incredible opportunities for all employees to engage remotely in classes, experiences, etc. Teams are rallying together to support each other.

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">There's several things about our company that make it a great place to work that I mention each year. And those are all still true. But management's approach and handling of the Covid-19 Pandemic has probably earned them a lifetime Most Excellent Place to Work in my books. Communication has been outstanding. Even though there were a lot of unknowns and uncertainty, executive management communicated what they were thinking/considering. They acknowledged the uncertainties, but reassured us that our work-from-home model was sustainable and that AFA would be extremely conservative/cautious in bringing folks back in the office. That alone was an immeasurable comfort; especially when compared with stories from family and friends, the differences were night and day. Management had weekly communication videos that included fairly deep-dives regarding the financial impact and sales operational adjustments which were implemented and I learned things about our company/products that I hadn't previously picked up in my 20+ years with the company. They were outstanding presentations which acknowledged the uncertainties and challenges we faced, but reassuring us of AFA's sustainability and plans if things deteriorated. Additionally, I heard that AFA continued to pay some of our 3rd party contractors, specifically our cafeteria workers (at The Grill), during the pandemic. Obviously The Grill was shutdown when everyone began working from home. My logical thought would be those 'colleagues' would have to rely on their company's policies regarding their continued pay. But, AFA management treated them as Colleagues and continued pay them to some level which astounded me. Management put the well-being of those 'colleagues' over profits and absolutely did the 'right thing' instead of looking at the bottom line. They've also came up with several creative ways to continue celebrations/activities that would have normally occur in the office. I'm not certain how our HR and Creative Services teams are keeping up with all the work/materials they've put out since the Pandemic. The video presentations have been fun and entertaining. And it seems like almost half of the communications regarded the well-being, mental/physical health of our workforce. It's been much appreciated. Then finally, AFA's continued involvement and support of our community during the pandemic has been stellar. I've always been extremely proud of our community support programs. They've simply stepped it up a couple of levels since the pandemic which has been gratifying.</div>\n",

When the pandemic hit, the company immediately made clear that every person's job was safe and that the executive team would take the pay hits required if the business suffered--layoffs were not coming and people could rest easy. The company invested heavily to ensure we had the personal capacity to continue working during the time, and made sure every employee had a chance to openly discuss and solution their individual needs. When Black Lives Matter erupted, the company made clear that they had not done enough and would try harder and do better. They put their money and the actions ahead of their words, and I believe handled it gracefully and powerfully. Leadership lives and breathes our operating principle to be open, honest, and direct. I always feel like I know where I stand and where the firm stands, and I trust them to be on the right side of history and own up to it when they are not.</div>\n",

Only employees with business in our building are allowed to enter. Extra safety precautions were put in place; such as extra wipes, facemasks, and temperature checks.

From the $1,000 bonus to outfit my home office, to the \"David Henshall check in's\" with the company with his videos, and calls with the team, and the multiple resources and cash donated to the communities in which we all work, and our ELT really taking ownership on employee well-being - there isn't lip service on Work-Life balance/integration, we're all living this as Citrites. I have worked for a few large technology companies prior to Citrix. I've never been more proud of where I work and what this company is doing across the board, and what it has done prior to the pandemic in terms of 'employee experience'. I was most impressed when we had the company wide \"Daring Dialogue\" where David &amp; Donna/ELT lead a conversation on race in the wake of the George Floyd video. We took two hours out of our day for a very raw and honest discussion. I was impressed that this was important to the company and that me, a mixed-race black employee, got to take part in something that was timely, and taken seriously.

Dealing with the Covid-19 situation, Orrick's actions have shown it's true colors - WE are a family, WE are in this together and WE will get through this together. Orrick has tried to keep all of their employees informed every step of the way and ease the uncertainty and anxiety created by this pandemic. Orrick has worked to avoid lay-offs at every level by having everyone share the financial hardships as well as offering financial benefits (tax benefits and working from home monthly stipends) whenever possible. When the financial strain was over, Orrick returned everyone to the pre-Covid-19 compensation levels. Orrick is always trying to help their members find a balance between work and home life and dealing with any stresses that result. Orrick offers virtual health exams as well as meditations and relaxation exercises - office chair yoga helps stretch the stress away. This racially turbulent time has taken a toll on our team members and Orrick has reached out and offered discussion and encouragement through speakers as well as offering up to 3 days of paid time off to deal with anxiety and unease.</div>\n",

During the last 7+ months of the pandemic, they recognized that employees have not been able to schedule as much time off due to childcare and family issues, and they added 4 company-wide holidays to the calendar year. They've gone out of their way to ensure employees have additional budget to set up home office space and pay for a portion of internet expenses. Management and HR regularly emphasize that there are no plans to reduce staffing due to the pandemic.

When we were asked to begin working from home there was a question on one of our team talks about how administrative assistants, who have always had a strong need to work from the office, would be able to perform their duties remotely. Brint [Ryan, Chairman and CEO] didn't skip a beat in his response in saying the COVID pandemic would be an opportunity to figure out a way to allow people in those, and similar, positions to work effectively remotely. He challenged the leaders of employees in those positions to figure out how to make it work This is unique from so many other companies my peers work for where they neither feel comfortable with the \"new normal\" operations procedures or secure in their employment since the pandemic hit.

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">I also want to give incredible kudos to the leadership of this healthcare company and to my hospital in particular regarding their management of the COVID crisis. Like many greater New York/New Jersey healthcare systems, we were overwhelmed with very sick patients in a very short period of time. It was a testament to excellent leadership (at all levels including the medical staff level), that were able to pivot almost overnight and shut down services and open up new venues of care to facilitate the needs of our community. And this was done essentially with internal resources alone. One example is the way whole wings or units of this hospital were methodically converted, like falling dominos (but in a planned and orderly fashion) into COVID wings. Staff from plant engineering converted literally hundreds of rooms into specialized respiratory isolation rooms by making them \"negative pressure\" isolation rooms. Nursing staffs shifted. Medical staffs shifted. And, all the complex ancillaries to keep everything running shifted. Extra space that had been closed were quickly re-opened to increase bed capacity. It was truly an amazing thing to behold. This was not done in 98% of other hospitals because they do not operate in a condition of daily excellence and the expectation that we will do whatever it takes to get the job done. Finally, I feel that during these trying times of the COVID pandemic for healthcare facilities, this company clearly tries to the very best of their ability to protect and accommodate their people. This is an amazing company to work for. I am glad to be part of the team.</div>\n",

We as a Nation are going through a horrible Pandemic that seems to have no end in sight. 2020 has been a very challenging and difficult year for everyone and at times many have felt hopeless and fearful for their future. I have seen and read about other companies who had to make the tough decision of reducing staff, furloughing their employees or just ending their employment due to the downturn in the economy. BayCare however, has been extremely wonderful, caring and understanding during these times of uncertainty. They have done what many companies have not been able to do. BayCare took the stance that no Team member would lose their job due to this Pandemic and would do everything in its power to keep staff employed. They constantly provide emails and positive communication that helps reassure us ad let us know that we are all in this together. Other companies should follow BayCare's example.

We transitioned into an all-virtual workforce remarkably smoothly. I really feel that all our leaders, from our wonderful CEO to our amazing Chief Talent Officer and down to front-line managers, have been genuinely concerned about our health and welfare during the crisis. We have all been sent surveys regularly to ask how we are doing, personally and professionally, and what we need. Based on survey results, every single one of us was given $700.00 to spend on wellness for ourselves. This special perk could be spent on exercise equipment, virtual classes, fitness devices, or even classes for our kids. It was a generous benefit and I know it made a big difference for me. I had not been taking very good care of my health the first few months of the pandemic, but after purchasing some simple home exercise equipment, I am working out every day and feel so much better. The survey also revealed that a large number of employees had not taken any time off since the pandemic started in mid-March. Our CEO and Chief Talent Officer were very concerned. In our last all-company meeting, we were all encouraged to take some time off. Our engineering department actually picked a specific Friday and told all of engineering to take that day off. I think that ServiceNow is the best company to work for in the world right now!</div>\n",

When the switch to work-from-home began and the economy slowed, management began taking precautions to protect both employees' health and jobs. They immediately made plans for people to work from home, ensured layoffs were the last possible measure that would be taken if business slowed down, and frequently checked in - both from the executive level and from the local management level - with employees to ensure that anyone who was struggling with staying home felt supported and connected to mental health resources. In particular, the conversation that Protiviti started about mental health even before the pandemic has created a surprisingly safe environment where employees aren't afraid to go to their managers or HR when they are struggling. My family still comment on how well my company responded to the needs of its employees' and the community after Hurricane Harvey, and they are always amazed when I tell them about the work-life balance and the encouragement to take vacation and maintain good mental health. Protiviti is an organization that takes care of its people.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"quote closed\">HP is just an outstanding place to work. I truly wish I could give our management team a standing ovation. In a very challenging year, HP has shown its true \"HP Way\" integrity through its treatment of employees and doing the right thing, especially once COVID pandemic started. From our CEO &amp; Executive Leadership team hosting virtual \"Connect\" sessions with 46k global employees via zoom in the first six weeks after COVID shelter in place started; to our CEO sending more than 46 emails to all employees this fiscal year alone (nearly one every week!) to stay in touch and transparent with everything going on; to hosting bi-weekly manager calls and our HR team creating \"HP Spirit Week\" with TONS of content for families and colleagues to stay connected to each other (including virtual dance parties, cooking classes, talent competitions and educational webinars and so much more!). This COVID pandemic has truly made us stronger as employees and as a company. I really appreciate that so much thought and care was put into our health and wellbeing from the get-go, including mandating all employees work from home right from the start of the pandemic; providing funds to employees to purchase home office equipment; and providing educational resources with our \"Print Play and Learn\" and \"Windows of Hope\" platforms of free printable activities during those difficult days when school wasn't available. ... I am so proud of my coworkers who worked tirelessly to design, 3D print and certify PPE for healthcare workers including face masks, face shields, mask adjusters, nasal swabs, hands-free door openers, and respirator parts. Incredibly, our employees combined with our partners globally have 3D printed more than 4 million PPE Parts! I also love a story from our Puerto Rico offices, whereby in a time when hand sanitizer was impossible to get, our teams pivoted our Ink-production facilities to make huge quantities of hand sanitizer for local hospitals, schools and our HP offices. Few companies have the technology to produce life-saving products overnight, much less the infrastructure to produce them locally at scale. But that’s exactly what we were able to do by mobilizing our digital manufacturing partner network. Something that's not COVID-related, but unique to HP, is our relentless focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. Our HP Board of Directors is the most diverse board of all US based technology companies (comprised of 58% minorities and 42% women), and our leadership team prioritizes DE&amp;I in all levels of the company. We don't just prioritize diversity internally, but also in policy and externally as well - in August 2020, our Chief Legal Officer and President of our Strategy &amp; Business Management business, Kim Rivera, appeared before California's State Senate to support AB-979 which would require minority representation in corporate boards. ... I am so proud to work for HP and every day, each of us brings our whole selves to work - even in this insane COVID environment, we are thriving and our business results are proving it.</div>\n",

There is not one company that any of my friends work for that has done that until they were forced to do so. On top of that, the flexibility and understanding that I have four kids at home that now have to be essentially home schooled and that my work schedule might have to change, was more than I could have ever expected. The reply I got back was \"Work will be here, just do what you need to do with the kids' schooling, and if that means you have to take a 2-3 hour lunch or you sign on early or late that's fine.\" The amount of stress that takes off myself and my wife is immeasurable. To add on top of that giving an allowance for internet and cellphone costs, offering medical assistance for myself or my family if we were to contract Covid -- I just can't say enough about how lucky I feel I am to be supported by Farmers.</div>\n",

Our household has two working parents and a young child who was home for 5 months during COVID-19, in arguably one of the most strictly shut down/quarantined areas of the country. Never once did upper management pressure about childcare or ask how I’d be able to manage my accounts or responsibilities. That trust was critical and invaluable and I realize that many, many employees did not have the same “luxury.” Waking up to know you have a job during a pandemic offers an incredible sense of peace and I will always be grateful for their leadership during this time. It said a lot to me about the way our executive team leads and does not want to micromanage.</div>\n",

Whether that is using the array of childcare services provided in our benefits, or the understanding of my direct manager and others in the department to care for my family as needed, they still treat me the same as everyone else, and therefore I know my family &amp; job are both safe. Especially since the pandemic began, and specifically in the beginning, managing a household with two children under 5 and two full time working parents, as long as my work was done, it did not matter how/when I did my work. I am allowed plenty of space to figure out creative ways to problems and get input from others on best ways to execute.</div>\n",
